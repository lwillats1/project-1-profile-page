    <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am Shadowheart, a cleric of Selûne, the Goddess of the Moon—though that wasn’t always the case. For most of my life, I walked in Shar, the Mistress of the Night’s shadow, bound by her will, believing her pain was strength. But the truth has a way of finding you, no matter how deeply it’s buried. Breaking free wasn’t easy. Unlearning the lies, repairing the damage... that’s a weight I’ll always carry. But I’ve chosen another path now—one of memory instead of loss, of hope instead of secrecy. I won’t pretend I have all the answers or that faith is suddenly simple. It isn’t. But I know this: I will never let anyone decide who I am for me again. So if you stand beside me, know this—I am still learning, still healing, still fighting. And if the past tries to pull me back into the dark? Well... let it try.</p>

    <h3>Friends</h3>
        <p>I met this group of ‘weirdos’ after crash landing on a beach, we were abducted and had slimy worms put into our heads. At first I didn’t trust any of them, especially Lae’zel- until it almost came to blows, and we decided our energy was better spent fighting cultists and monsters.</p>
        <p>This is Jennifer English- some people say we sound very similar, even that we look alike- but I’m not quite sure...  </p>
