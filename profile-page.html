    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I am Shadowheart, a cleric of Selûne, the Goddess of the Moon—though that wasn’t always the case. For most of my life, I walked in Shar, the Mistress of the Night’s shadow, bound by her will, believing her pain was strength. But the truth has a way of finding you, no matter how deeply it’s buried. Breaking free wasn’t easy. Unlearning the lies, repairing the damage... that’s a weight I’ll always carry. But I’ve chosen another path now—one of memory instead of loss, of hope instead of secrecy. I won’t pretend I have all the answers or that faith is suddenly simple. It isn’t. But I know this: I will never let anyone decide who I am for me again. So if you stand beside me, know this—I am still learning, still healing, still fighting. And if the past tries to pull me back into the dark? Well... let it try.</p>
